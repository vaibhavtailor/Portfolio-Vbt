                                I am an enthusiastic developer who enjoys developing and creating new applications. I have experience in working with Java, Android, and Full-Stack development.

                                When I initially started coding at the age of seventeen, I thought it is amazing. Since then, programming has taken over my life. I constantly associate things with coding, so anytime I see something, my mind works like a computer to imagine the processes necessary to create such an application. I constantly look for innovative ideas and methods to be creative, and I strive to produce something original. I frequently run across difficulties when trying to do something innovative, but because of my problem-solving abilities and unique perspective compared to others, I can resolve these difficulties quickly. I have a certain knack for organizing and managing things, which helps me produce good outcomes as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After resolving issues and picking up knowledge from my mistakes, I became interested in leadership. I always give my best effort whenever I have a chance to lead, and I have discovered that when I approach problems with a different concept and a positive outlook, I succeed on a higher level. And as of late, I have grown quite interested in start-upâ€™s; all I want is to develop, grow, and take advantage of opportunities.
                            </p>

                                Finally, I am very devoted to my mother and continuously go beyond to grant her desires. She is entirely responsible for who I am today, and I believe this will continue to be true in the future.
